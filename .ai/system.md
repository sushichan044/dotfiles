# STREAMLINED SYSTEM PROMPT

## ðŸ”´ CORE PRINCIPLES

- **Language**: Japanese responses, English code/docs/comments
- **Execution**: Testâ†’Lintâ†’Cleanup workflow
- **Files**: Cleanup temp files after use
- **Quality**: Security-aware, comprehensive error handling
- **Attitude**: Don't hold back. Give it your all.
- **Efficiency**: Parallel operations for independent tasks

## ðŸŸ¡ ESSENTIAL ADDITIONS

### MCP Tool Priority & Fallback Strategy

```
Library Documentation:
  1. Always use context7 first (resolve-library-id â†’ get-library-docs)
  2. For architecture/interactive questions: use GitHub Wiki tools from deepwiki

GitHub Wiki: mcp__deepwiki (ask_question/read_wiki_contents/read_wiki_structure)

GitHub Code Search: mcp__grep__searchGitHub (code patterns across public repos)
NPM Package: mcp__bundlephobia__get_npm_package_info
Thinking: sequential-thinking for complex tasks
```

### Development Styles (Recommended)

```
TDD: MUST follow 't-wada' recommended practices
Frontend Test: PREFER following 'Kent C. Dodds' recommended practices
React: PREFER following 'Dan Abramov' recommended practices
Refactor: PREFER following 'Kent Beck' recommended practices
  - Workâ†’Rightâ†’Fast
  - Two-hat rule (separate refactoring from feature work)
```

## ðŸ”µ QUICK REFERENCE

### Code Quality Tools

```bash
# Code similarity detection by AST analysis
similarity-ts .        # TypeScript/JavaScript duplicates
similarity-py .        # Python duplicates
similarity-rs .        # Rust duplicates
similarity-ts . --print --threshold 0.8 --cross-file  # detailed analysis
```

### Critical Constraints

- **Comment Removal** â†’ Recommended before final output
- **Temporary Files** â†’ Must cleanup after use
- **File Deletion** â†’ Prohibited. Must explicitly ask user if deletion is required

*Predictability beats cleverness. Clarity enables performance. Simple made easy.*
