## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Analysis Overwhelm**
   - Symptom: Too many improvement opportunities identified
   - Solution: Priority matrix to focus on highest impact changes
   - Prevention: Limit scope to most critical 3-5 areas

2. **Implementation Complexity Underestimation**
   - Symptom: Proposals seem too ambitious
   - Solution: Break into smaller, manageable phases
   - Prevention: Include complexity assessment in each proposal

3. **User Disruption Concerns**
   - Symptom: Fear of breaking existing workflows
   - Solution: Gradual rollout with fallback options
   - Prevention: Include migration strategy in all proposals

### Recovery Procedures

1. **If analysis is insufficient**: Extend sequential thinking process to 15-20 thoughts
2. **If proposals lack specificity**: Focus on concrete, actionable changes
3. **If implementation seems risky**: Design more conservative, phased approach
