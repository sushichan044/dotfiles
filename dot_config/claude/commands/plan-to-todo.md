# Convert Plan to Checklist document, document title: $ARGUMENTS

Step 1: Check the plan you created and convert it into a checklist in Markdown format. Copy it exactly.
Step 2: The task list should use checklist syntax `[ ]`. Begin each task phase with the word “Step.”
Step 3: Save the file to `./docs/plan/` with the filename `<$ARGUMENTS>.md`. If $ARGUMENTS is not provided, choose a filename you recommend that is fewer than 15 characters.
